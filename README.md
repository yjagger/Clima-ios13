# Clima-ios13

I am learning Swift and this is a guided project from the udemy Learning ios app development Course by Dr Angela Yu (appbrewery)
An ios app to show current weather details of any city.


**Brief - App Behaviour and features**

Upon loading, the app will show the city name and it's weather on the home screen.
The user can also type in any valid city, from all across the world adn the city name, temperature, and the icon describing the weather will reflect and update to show current weather of the city.
Temperature is - in Metric Units.

**The main branch is the starting project ( cloned from https://github.com/appbrewery/Clima-iOS13 )**
**The develop branch is the final project source code, modified by me**

Note for devs
- If you run this on the XCode simulator then, you might need to change the location ( in the Simulator toolbar select Debug -> Location ) to let the Simulator chose it's location.
- In the file Clima/Mode/WeatherManager.swift, update the app id to the app Id to your app, after registering with Open Weather. Read this link for further info
